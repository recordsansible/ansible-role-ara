      Make sure to have Ansible and ARA use it for everything to work properly.

      This can be done from using Ansible or the ARA CLI commands directly from that directory or by using the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable, like so:
      export ANSIBLE_CONFIG={{ ara_config_path }}/ansible.cfg
